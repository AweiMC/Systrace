## 📦 Installation

Systrace is flexible in deployment:

- Can be installed **server-side only** ✅  
- Can be installed **client-side only** ✅  
- Can be installed on **both sides** ✅  

This means you don't need the client to install it for the server to run properly.

Download the correct version for your Minecraft loader and version from:

- [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/systrace)
- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/systrace)

Place the `.jar` into your `mods/` folder and launch the game.
